## 🧠 How It Works

1. The script asks you for the folder path.  
2. It scans all files inside that folder.  
3. Each file gets a new clean name like `file_1.ext`.  
4. It skips duplicate names and updates automatically.  
5. Finally, it prints and saves the rename results to a log file.

## 🧩 Example Output

Enter folder path: /Download/test 📦 Renamed: photo.jpg → file_1.jpg 📦 Renamed: report.pdf → file_2.pdf 🎯 Total Files renamed: 2 ✅️ File renamed Successfully!

## 📜 Usage

1. Copy the script inside your project folder.  
2. Run the file using Python.

4. The tool will rename all files automatically.
